# Laptop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using machine learning techniques based on key hardware specifications and features. By leveraging Python, data analysis, and machine learning models, the goal was to develop an accurate prediction system to assist users in estimating laptop prices based on various attributes.

Key Features:

● Data Collection & Preprocessing: Collected and cleaned a dataset of 1,000+ laptops, handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data to improve model accuracy.

● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, uncovering key relationships between laptop specifications (e.g., RAM, storage, processor type) and their prices.

● Feature Engineering: Extracted and transformed relevant features, ensuring optimal model performance.

● Machine Learning Models:
    
    ▶ Trained and evaluated multiple models, including:
     
      ◆ Linear Regression
     
      ◆ Decision Tree Regressor
     
      ◆ Random Forest Regressor
     
  ● Model Evaluation: Compared model performances using metrics like R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  
  ● Achieved an accuracy of up to 89% with the Random Forest Regressor, which outperformed other models.

  
Deployment & Visualization:

  ◆ Built an interactive UI using Streamlit, allowing users to input laptop specifications and get real-time price predictions.
  
  ◆ Integrated Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization, helping users understand the impact of different features on pricing.
  
Tech Stack Used:

● Programming Languages: Python
● Libraries & Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Streamlit
● Model Deployment: Streamlit
